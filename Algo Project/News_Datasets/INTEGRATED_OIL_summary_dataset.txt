A, Definitive Rating Assigned Aaa (sf)Cl. B, Definitive Rating Assigned Aa3 (sf)Cl. C, Definitive Rating Assigned A2 (sf)Cl. D, Definitive Rating Assigned Baa3 (sf)RATINGS RATIONALEOverviewThe transaction's Aaa advance rate (the ratio of senior certificate to the Moody's Value) is 31.36%.Moody's uses the advance rate to determine whether the asset value is sufficient to support a targeted rating level given the size of the transaction's liabilities.Key transaction featuresCash management: In comparison to the previously rated HPA sponsored SFR transactions and other SFR transactions, the cash management provisions in this transaction are weaker.  The transaction allows the borrower to pay the taxes, capex, and insurance when these costs occur instead of setting aside monthly reserves to cover these expenses.Rating Action: Moody's affirms the City of Baltimore, MD's GOULT at Aa2; outlook stableGlobal Credit Research - 24 Mar 2022New York, March 24, 2022 -- Moody's Investors Service has affirmed the Aa2 ratings on the City of Baltimore, MD's general obligation unlimited tax (GOULT) debt.

The hotel and convention center should continue to recover post-shutdown, and enable the eventual replenishment of indentured and debt service reserve funds, while minimizing any future drains on city resources.RATING OUTLOOKThe stable outlook reflects our expectation that the city's tax base and revenues will continue to improve given several large scale development projects, and the city's financial position will not weaken despite outsized capital needs for the wastewater system.Rating Action: Moody's affirms West Virginia University Health System's A2; outlook stableGlobal Credit Research - 24 Mar 2022New York, March 24, 2022 -- Moody's Investors Service affirms the A2 on the revenue bonds of West Virginia University Health System (""WVUHS"" or the ""system"") issued through the West Virginia Hospital Finance Authority.

Under the terms of the deal, BP will purchase Archaea Energy for roughly $4.1 billion, including its net debt of $800 million.  The $26-per-share transaction price represents a premium of about 38% to Archaea's volume-weighted average stock price over the prior 30-day period.BP (BP) closed the most recent trading day at $30.48, moving +0.49% from the previous trading session.Archaea's success paved the way for Rice Acquisition Corp., a special purpose acquisition company led by former Rice Energy CEO Daniel Rice IV, to acquire Archaea.BP expects biogas to be a significant part of its energy transition portfolio by 2030, thanks in large part to a $4 billion acquisition of a Houston-based company.BP  PLC said it had agreed to buy U.S. biogas producer  Archaea Energy  for $3.3 billion plus debt in a bet on growing demand from customers for renewable fuel.  The British oil major said Monday that the acquisition of Houston-based Archaea—its biggest deal since its 2018 acquisition of U.S. shale assets—would expand the company’s clean-energy portfolio.  BP  like other big oil companies, is shifting more resources into lower-carbon energy, even as it continues with its core business of producing oil and gas.BP has announced its biggest acquisition in lower-carbon fuels with the planned purchase of a US-listed biogas producer for $4.1bn as the UK oil major seeks to accelerate its push away from fossil fuel assets.  The Houston-based Archaea Energy produces the gas by processing organic waste from landfill sites and the farming industry.

Under a technical service agreement signed with Venezuela's oil company PDVSA this summer, Chevron asked the U.S. Treasury Department to relax sanctions on Venezuela, allowing the company to take operational control and have a greater say in procurement and trading at the four oil ventures it shares with PDVSA.  But the State Department has insisted that any relevant easing of sanctions will only come if Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro returns to talks and takes concrete steps toward free elections.Home Depot co-founder Bernie Marcus says 40-year high levels of inflation would come down if the Biden administration makes it easier for oil companies to drill in the country.Many energy companies are still reluctant to go back to their trigger-happy exploration and drilling days despite high oil and gas prices and record profitsChevron (CVX) closed the most recent trading day at $161.31, moving +0.73% from the previous trading session.Warren Buffet’s philosophy relies on identifying stocks to buy and hold.

Also, in Europe’s latest effort to avoid catastrophic energy shortages this winter, Germany’s chancellor Olaf Scholz imposed a compromise on the government’s fractious ruling coalition to keep the country’s three remaining nuclear plants running.  In today’s newsletter, I look at two deals this week that cut to the heart of how energy executives are responding to the energy crisis in diverging ways.Japan is still checking details of a Russian decree on the giant Sakhalin-1 oil and gas project and will continue talks with stakeholders in the previous operating consortium to decide whether to invest in a new Russian operator.  ""We have repeatedly said Sakhalin-1 is a very important project for Japan,"" Japan's industry minister, Yasutoshi Nishimura, told a news conference on Tuesday.Exxon Mobil says it has left the country after Moscow transferred the energy company’s holding to a Russian entity.Many energy companies are still reluctant to go back to their trigger-happy exploration and drilling days despite high oil and gas prices and record profitsExxon Mobil (XOM) closed the most recent trading day at $100.62, moving +1.44% from the previous trading session.(Bloomberg) -- Exxon Mobil Corp. completed its exit from Russia, calling the departure an “expropriation” of its main Russian operation and potentially setting up a future legal challenge. “With two decrees, the Russian government has unilaterally terminated our interests in Sakhalin-1 and the project has been transferred to a Russian operator,” an Exxon spokesperson said in a statement. “We have safely exited Russia following the expropriation.”READ: Aug, 30 Exxon Prepares for Lawsuit as PutinExxonMobil said it has exited Russia after government “expropriation” of its largest oilfield in the country, increasing the likelihood of a multibillion-dollar legal fight with the Kremlin.  The US oil supermajor said president Vladimir Putin’s government had “unilaterally terminated” its interest in the Sakhalin-1 oil and gas project in Russia’s far east and that the field has been transferred to a domestic operator.  The announcement on Monday marked the latest cut in energy ties between Russia and the west following Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine, unravelling decades of effort by American and European companies to tap Russia’s vast oil and gas reserves.In a historically-volatile year in the market so far in 2022, dividends have been a significant perk, helping to shield investors from drawdowns.Exxon Mobil Corp said on Monday that it left Russia completely after President Vladimir Putin expropriated its properties following seven months of discussions over an orderly transfer of its 30% stake in a major oil project.  Exxon did not say if it received any compensation for the assets, which it had valued at more than $4 billion.  An Exxon spokesperson declined to comment on whether it will proceed to contest the seizure through an international arbitration process, a possibility flagged in August.Think price levels will be back to normal soon?
