Currently, Apple's dividend yield sits at just 0.71%, but an investment of $141,000 -- or 1,084 shares at the current price -- would still generate $1,000 in passive income each year.  Additionally, Apple should benefit from several catalysts in the coming years, which leaves room for share-price appreciation.Warren Buffett is widely regarded as the greatest investor in the world, and even at 91, he continues to steer the Berkshire Hathaway investment company to success.  The Oracle of Omaha has consistently outperformed the broader market, delivering an average annual return of 20% over his 55 years at Berkshire, which is double that of the benchmark S&P 500 index.  With both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100 technology index trading in a bear market, it might be worthwhile to treat Buffett's portfolio as a guiding light right now.Other tech stocks might offer more growth, but these are perfect for the current economic environment.One of Buffett's tips for the investing community is to go in big when you see a good opportunity.  This theme is quite evident in Berkshire's portfolio, which is heavily concentrated among just a handful of names.

Sweden’s Ericsson was hit hardest as its shares fell 14 per cent in trading on Thursday to a two-year low, coming close to their lowest level since 2018.  Finland’s Nokia also suffered as its shares dropped 5 per cent as investors worried about delays in signing new patents and licensing deals with telecoms groups.Ericsson stock tumbled more than 14% early Thursday after the Swedish telecom giant’s earnings missed expectations in the third quarter.  The telecom equipment maker reported adjusted earnings per share of 1.56 Swedish crowns (14 cents), 10% lower than the year-ago period and below the analyst consensus of 1.77 Swedish crowns, according to FactSet.  The company said its gross margin fell to 41% from 44% as component costs rose and it invested more in maintaining supply chain resilience.Telecom equipment makers Nokia and Ericsson were among the worst performers in Europe on Thursday, bruised by ongoing patent battles which cut profit margins and offset strong demand for 5G equipment.  While the revenue of both companies beat expectations thanks to the rollout of 5G, delayed royalty payments meant their core profit missed analysts' expectations.  Shares in Ericsson slumped 12% and were the worst performers in the STOXX 600 while Nokia shares fell almost 5% to be among the worst.By Peter NurseThird quarter highlightsBy Scott KanowskyCaroline Berns, Head of Diversity & Inclusion and Talent Acquisition, MMEA;4.159999847412109;Despite supply chain constraints, Nokia (NOK) third-quarter 2022 earnings match the estimates on higher revenues.Nokia Corp (NYSE: NOK) reported a third-quarter FY22 net sales growth of 16% year-on-year (6% in constant currency) to €6.24 billion.
