Ant's beginnings can be traced to Alipay, which was launched by Alibaba in 2004 as a payment service that aimed to address Chinese buyers' and sellers' concerns about transacting online in the country's then-nascent e-commerce market.

This makes it worthwhile to examine what the stock has in store.Some of Asia’s largest hedge funds scooped up large stakes in Chinese e-commerce giant Pinduoduo in the third quarter while cutting holdings in its rival JD.com, according to their latest regulatory filings.  The switch seemed to be driven by the view that Pinduoduo's global ambition and inexpensive products would give it an edge over the purely domestic JD.com business.  HHLR Advisers, an investment management arm under billionaire Zhang Lei’s private equity firm Hillhouse Capital Group, reported a 43% jump in the number of shares it holds in Pinduoduo in the past quarter, while it sold 25% of its JD.com U.S. listed American depositary receipts (ADRs).U.S.-listed Chinese stocks rallied on Tuesday after President Biden and Chinese leader Xi Jinping [restored dialogue](https://www.wsj.com/articles/biden-xi-talks-mark-shift-in-u-s-china-ties-toward-managing-fierce-competition-11668534046?mod=panda_wsj_author_alert) ahead of a G-20 summit in Indonesia.

But here's why the S&P 500 could pause.Stock splits used to be much more common, but the rise of fractional shares in brokerage accounts has nullified that practice, especially in the U.S. However, some companies have split their stocks recently (like Tesla, Alphabet, and Amazon) to make stock options a more accessible form of compensation to employees.  All three of these companies' stocks were trading above $1,000 when this split occurred, making this a standard threshold for determining if a company should split its stock.  One stock that may be close to splitting is MercadoLibre (NASDAQ: MELI), which currently sits at around $1,000 per share.Economic uncertainty sent the Nasdaq Composite spiraling into a bear market this year, and many excellent growth stocks fell sharply during the stock market meltdown.  For instance, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and MercadoLibre (NASDAQ: MELI) saw their share prices plunge 28.2% and 24.3%, respectively, in 2022.
